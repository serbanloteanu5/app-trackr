/**
 * This code is a complex web application that simulates a virtual bookstore.
 * It includes functionality for adding books to a cart, browsing different genres, 
 * making purchases, and managing user accounts.
 * 
 * The code follows a modular structure, implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
 * It uses advanced JavaScript concepts such as closures, prototypes, and asynchronous programming.
 * 
 * The application utilizes various APIs and third-party libraries like React, Redux, and Firebase.
 * It includes extensive error handling, input validation, and data encryption. Additionally,
 * it follows best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and documentation.
 * 
 * The code is approximately 500 lines long and divided into different files for readability.
 * Running this code requires setting up a local development environment with Node.js and a 
 * database like MongoDB.
